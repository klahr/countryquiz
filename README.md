Idea and development by Tomi Lepp√§nen.

Concept
-------
The idea of the quiz came was born while I was watching a video on YouTube
channel called Lingualizer where the youtuber recognized different flags. Later
the game was improved to include also maps and capital cities.

Adding languages
----------------
Adding a language can mean adding data in another language or adding
translation files for UI translations. Both don't need to be present for a
language. Please see TRANSLATING.md for more information.
