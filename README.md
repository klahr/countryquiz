Country Quiz
============
Country Quiz is a quiz game about states in the world. You can practise
recognition of flags, maps and capitals. Results are collected into local
database for you to see your own progress.

Idea and development by Tomi Lepp√§nen.

Concept
-------
The idea of the quiz came was born while I was watching a video on YouTube
channel called Lingualizer where the youtuber recognized different flags. Later
the game was improved to include also maps and capital cities.

Adding languages
----------------
Adding a language can mean adding data in another language or adding
translation files for UI translations. Both don't need to be present for a
language. Please see TRANSLATING.md for more information.

Remaining work
--------------
Known issues:

- Map is not clipped correctly when switching between ambiences during Map quiz.
- Hiding window when Quiz is about to start or continue breaks quiz.
- Score graph subpage is missing busy indicator.
